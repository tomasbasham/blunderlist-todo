# blunderlist-todo

A fictitious todo application through which to teach how to implement a
microservice architecture. For the full list of services required to run this
application visit
[Blunderlist](https://github.com/tomasbasham?utf8=âœ“&tab=repositories&q=blunderlist)
on GitHub.

This repository implements an API that manages tasks and their creation,
providing an isolated data abstraction from other components of the overall
system. Data from this service may be further decorated with data obtained from
other services in some downstream closer to the client.

The intent of this repository is to provide the most optimal API surface for
the domain with which it is concerned, issuing unique resource handles that may
be referred to in other services.

The code here attempts to follow the principles of [Domain Driven
Design](https://www.google.com/search?q=domain-driven+design); where my take on
the subject can be seen on [my
blog](https://tomasbasham.dev/development/2019/10/26/domain-driven-design-in-practice).
